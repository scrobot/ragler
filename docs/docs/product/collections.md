# Collections

## Purpose
A collection represents a **context of knowledge use**, not just a bag of chunks. It defines:
- Intended audience
- Usage scenarios
- Expected style/tone

## Management rules
- **Creation:** Requires purpose description.
- **Deletion:** Must be explicit; prevents orphaned chunks.
- **Association:** A chunk must always belong to a collection.
