# Collections

## Purpose
A collection represents a **context of knowledge use**, not just a bag of chunks. It defines:
- Intended audience
- Usage scenarios
- Expected style/tone

## Collection Management

The system provides comprehensive collection management capabilities:

### Creation
- Requires descriptive purpose statement
- Should define intended audience and use cases
- Must specify expected style and level of detail

### Editing
- Collection description can be updated
- Parameters and metadata can be modified
- Purpose refinement without republishing chunks

### Composition Management
- Assign chunks to collections during session workflow
- Move chunks between collections (re-publishing required)
- View all chunks within a collection

### Deletion Protection
- Collection deletion requires explicit user confirmation
- System prevents accidental loss of chunks
- Orphaned chunks warning before deletion

### Key Rules
- **Association:** Every chunk must belong to exactly one collection
- **Selection:** Collection must be selected before publishing
- **Immutability:** Published chunks retain collection assignment until explicitly changed
